# Bruce Hall VR

A simple website I whipped up to display some 360 degree photos I took before the residential college I lived at (Bruce Hall) was demolished.

I'm using the library Pannellum to render the photos and simple JQuery scripts to provide a nice UI around the photos.

*Please note*: Only one photo has been uploaded (reception). I will shortly be uploading more.
